# Phase 0: Prerequisite
To have at least a bit of technical knowledge in the sections for -
- [Linux basic fundamentels](https://linuxjourney.com)
- [Networking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QhU9jd03a0)
- [Cloud fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsRBftzZsQo)

## Key Aspect
Honestly, nobody is asking you to be an expert. Just familiarize yourself with the basic terms to follow through with the steps. 

## Things you should be able familiar with at the end of this phase

### Linux
Navigate with the `cd` command.
- Listing contents with `ls` command.
- Create, copy, move, rename, files and directories with `mkdir`, `cp`, `rm`, and `touch`.
- Locate things with `whereis`, `which`, and `find`.
- Install and remove packages `yum` or `dnf`.
- Control permissions with `chown`, `chgrp`, `chmod`.
- Compression and archiving with `tar`.
- Elevaing privileges with `sudo`.
- Login to systems with secure shell `ssh`.

### Networking
- OSI Model
- IP Addressing and Subnets
- TCP / UDP
- DNS

### Cloud Fundamentals
- Networking inside Cloud (VPCs, subnets & associations, route tables, IP addresses, DNS)
- EC2 fundamentals (Instance type, size, AMI, user data configs)
- Key-pair workings with `ssh`

### Good to follow
- IAM defined admin user for using AWS.
- AWS root user should be disabled or never be used except defining administrator users and Identity Access Management (IAM) roles in AWS.
